# singeleton-pattern


## Definition
The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that focuses on creating only one instance of a class. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where having multiple instances of a class could lead to conflicts or inconsistencies.

The primary goal of the Singleton pattern is to make a single object of a class globally accessible within a program. To achieve this, the pattern involves creating a private constructor for the class, preventing external instantiation. Instead, a public method, typically named `getInstance`, is introduced. This method checks if an instance of the class already exists. If not, it instantiates the class and sets the reference variable to the object. If an instance already exists, the method simply returns that object.

By using the Singleton pattern, the regular constructor is hidden, and other classes are forced to use the `getInstance` method for object creation. This ensures that only one object of the class is ever created, preventing confusion and conflicts in larger projects or projects with multiple developers. Additionally, this approach allows for lazy creation, meaning the object is only instantiated when truly needed, enhancing efficiency, especially for large objects.

However, it's essential to be aware of potential trade-offs, such as issues in multi-threaded environments where multiple threads may access the shared single object simultaneously. Evaluating the use of the Singleton pattern, or any design pattern, requires a good understanding of its workings and potential consequences. Despite variations in the implementation, the Singleton pattern consistently aims to provide global access to a class restricted to one instance, emphasizing its purpose over the exact code details.

In summary, the Singleton pattern is a powerful technique for ensuring the uniqueness of a class instance, offering benefits in design clarity and preventing unintended conflicts in various software development scenarios.

## Example

```JS
// In JavaScript, there is no direct way to declare a constructor as private. However, you can simulate private access by using a common convention or pattern that signals to other developers that a method or property is intended for internal use only. In the provided example, the constructor for _DatabaseConnectionManager is technically public, but its visibility is limited by convention. The constructor is named _DatabaseConnectionManager, starting with an underscore. This naming convention is widely used to indicate that a method or property is intended for internal use and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.

class _DatabaseConnectionManager {
  constructor(databaseUrl) {
    // Private variable to store the single instance
    this._instance = null;
    this.databaseUrl = databaseUrl;
  }

  static getInstance(databaseUrl) {
    // If an instance does not exist, create one
    if (!this._instance) {
      this._instance = new DatabaseConnectionManager(databaseUrl);
    }
    return this._instance;
  }
}

// Usage
const dbManager1 = DatabaseConnectionManager.getInstance("example.com/db");
const dbManager2 = DatabaseConnectionManager.getInstance("another-example.com/db");

// Both instances point to the same object
console.log(dbManager1 === dbManager2); // Output: true

```

In this JavaScript example, the `DatabaseConnectionManager` class uses a static method `getInstance` to control the creation of the single instance. The private variable `_instance` is used to store and retrieve the instance. When multiple parts of the codebase call `getInstance`, they all receive a reference to the same instance, ensuring that there's only one `DatabaseConnectionManager` throughout the application.
